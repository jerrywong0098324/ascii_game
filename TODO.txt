Memory Leaks found when just launching and exiting the game
More Memory Leaks can be found when the game transit to Level_01 and exiting
the game afterwards

DONE: Fixed memory leaks
18/6/2020
Some issues with the Memory Leaks detection... No Memory Leaks when launching
and exiting the game. 
Fixed Memory Leaks when exiting the game from Level_01 as I did not call the
Map::Exit() inside Pause.cpp Exit() function, thus I didn't delete Pause's
map

Completed Fog Logic
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Doing base class and logic for Items, firstly implementing Pickaxe class
NOTE: use dynamic_cast to access individual class's Init() function, while 
using parent's class function to override the function of the Item

21/6/2020
Completed logic for Inventory, Pickaxe, Rock, and Loading and Saving of files!
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Doing logic for Ice blocks and reworking Player's movement class to have
intended feature with ice. Added a PlayerStatus to determine the state of the
player.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
30/6/2020
Completed logic for Ice blocks, able to slide. Reworked level such that it 
has a copy of a playing map, so that it can be original map can go back after
player walks over it
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1/7/2020
Completed logic for Boulder block. Need to rework Ice block.
-> When Boulder moves over Ice, because of update loops (Ice blocks being
updated before Boulders), Ice block's code remove Boulder (by replacing the
character at that position with an Ice block.)

Next up, do invisible blocks. This is to declare an invisible wall that the
player cannot pass.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
5/7/2020
Reworked Ice block codes such that it works with boulder and future blocks that
may not be a collision, but can be put over an ice block

Completed invisible wall. Can just use ! on map to declare invisible wall
