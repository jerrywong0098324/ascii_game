Memory Leaks found when just launching and exiting the game
More Memory Leaks can be found when the game transit to Level_01 and exiting

DONE: Fixed memory leaks
18/6/2020
Some issues with the Memory Leaks detection... No Memory Leaks when launching
and exiting the game. 
Fixed Memory Leaks when exiting the game from Level_01 as I did not call the
Map::Exit() inside Pause.cpp Exit() function, thus I didn't delete Pause's
map
